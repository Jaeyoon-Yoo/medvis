History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo M with a hx of depression, hyperlipidemia, and 
low back pain who presents with altered mental status. The pt is 
unable to provide any history. Per his husband, on ___ night 
he developed lethargy and a productive cough with brown sputum. 
The patient went to bed earlier than usual and awoke later in 
the night agitated and yelling ""get me out of here."" Yesterday 
he slept through the most of the day, drinking only sips of 
water. He got out of bed every 20 min for small bowel movements

speaking to a friend who reportedly died in ___. He has fallen 
twice in the past two days, the first time on his side and the 
second time with his head hitting the floor. He has not had any 
sick contacts. He was brought to the ED by his husband out of 
concern for worsening symptoms.

In the ED, initial VS were T 99 HR 110 BP 101/54 RR 33 O2Sat 
89%. He was oriented to self only. Initial labs demonstrated a 
leukopenia with a WBC 1.8 and 20% bands. CHEM showed an elevated 
BUN (48) and creatinine (2.5) as well as HCO3 19 corresponding 
to an anion gap of 25. Lactate was 7.8. CXR demonstrated 
extensive opacification of the right lung and a patchy opacity 
of the left lung base concerning for a multifocal pneumonia. He 
was intubated for worsening hypoxemia. He was sedated with 
fentanyl/versed and placed on CMV 500/14/10/100%. He was given 
ceftriaxone/azithromycin followed by levofloxacin. He was also 
given 50 g IV dextrose for a glucose of 66 and 3.5 L NS in the 
ED.

On arrival to the MICU, VS were T 98.5 HR 97 BP 107/47 RR 15

IMAGING:
=======
___ CT C-spine:
IMPRESSION:     
1.  No acute cervical spine fracture.  
2.  Airspace consolidation at the right lung apex, consistent 
with pneumonia.   
3.  Endotracheal tube balloon appears to be overinflated. 
.
___ CT head:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Minimally displaced fracture of the right nasal bone, age 
indeterminate.  
2.  Sinus disease as noted above.   
3.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
.
___ CXR:
IMPRESSION:     
Extensive right lung opacification and patchy left basilar 
opacity concerning for multifocal pneumonia. 
.
___ RUQ US:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  Moderate gallbladder distension with minimal gallbladder 
wall thickening; no stones identified.  Mild gallbladder wall 
thickening is not specific.  In the setting of sepsis, if the 
etiology is not known and if there are clinical findings 
concerning for acalculous cholecystitis, then the possibility 
could be considered.  Hepatobiliary scanning may be useful if 
that is a potential clinical concern.     
2.  Mild prominence of the pancreatic duct up to 4 mm.     
3. The liver is diffusely increased in echogenicity and 
suggestive of fatty deposition within the liver.  More 
significant hepatic disease including significant hepatic 
fibrosis / cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this 
study, however. 

___ duplex lower extremities:
IMPRESSION: 
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg. 

___ CXR:
FINDINGS:  There is no significant change compared to prior 
examination with redemonstration of scattered asymmetric right 
greater than left opacities compatible with multifocal 
pneumonia.  There is a probable small left pleural effusion.  
There is no pneumothorax.  An NG tube remains in appropriate 
position.  A right-sided PICC line terminates in the mid SVC. 
  
IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia, relatively unchanged in 
appearance from 
prior examination. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of hypertension 
and depression, who presented with respiratory failure in the 
setting of a multifocal pneumonia. He was intubated in the MICU 
for multiple days, then successfully extubated. His 
post-extubation course was complicated by prolonged delirium.  

#) Respiratory failure, secondary to viral pneumonia developing 
into ARDS: Given initial asymmetric airspace opacities, 
leukopenia, and elevated lactate, the patient's respiratory 
failure was almost certainly caused by his pneumonia. He was 
intubated for this. On the ventilator, pt had elevated pCO2 
despite significant minute ventilation. Repeat CXR AM of ___ 
showed progression of airspace disease on left and no change on 
R, with more symmetric involvement. Patient found to be 
parainfluenza positive, sputum culture with rare growth of strep 
pneumo. BAL and previous cultures also demonstrated yeast. He 
was on pressors for the first several days, but these were 
stopped by ___. The first day of antibiotics was 
___ with vanc/Cefepime/levo. Due to probable drug 
rash, Cefepime changed to imipenem on ___. Patient was then 
switched to Meropenem. On ___ pt was seen by ID who felt we 
should continue current abx and start azithromycin 500mg (Day ___. He was extubated on ___. The night of ___ desatted to 
70혪s after being 2L neg during the day, required high low and 
suctioning with improvement. Fungal markers negative. On the 
morning of ___ he experienced an episode of bradycardia with 
stridor concerning for upper airway obstruction with tachypnea, 
which cleared spontaneously. Abx were stopped on ___. Night of 
___ restarted lasix (had been held for metabolic alkalosis). 
___ AM satting 90% on 6L, had to go back on face tent. He was 
diuresed and got lower extremity duplex scans as well as a 
repeat chest xray to rule out PE as a cause of hypoxia and 
tachycardia. He improved significantly with lasix.

#Eosinophilia. Noted to have abs eosinophil count approximately 
850 on ___, increasing on ___ to 1200. Multiple medications 
could be contributing, may coincide with seroquel. LFT혪s stable. 
He was not on lasix at this time. Eosinophils trended up peaking 
at 13.4 and then trending down to 9.4 on discharge. 
 
#Fevers: The patient had persistent fevers after spiking to 
102.1 on ___, most likely from active parainfluenza infection 
or drug-induced reaction. CXR remained largely unchanged and 
showed continued multifocal pneumonia/ARDS. Cultures were 
negative to date since ___, including catheter tip culture. 
Echocardiography did not demonstrate evidence of a vegetation. 
Serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to 
seroquel was less likely given his CK was normal. Sputum 
cultures demonstrated yeast. By ___ tmax decreased to 99.8 
axillary. LP was performed on ___ to evaluate for HSV 
encephalopathy given a positive HSV oral swab and his altered 
mental status. He was started on acyclovir at that time. 
However, CSF count was unimpressive (WBC 3). His fevers resolved 
by ___. 

#Altered mental status: Pt was persistently delirious after 
extubation with gradual improvement in mental status, especially 
after acyclovir was started. Sedating medications were 
minimized, and the pt was given seroquel for agitation. He was 
continued on acyclovir through ___ when his HSV PCR from the 
CSF was noted to be negative. He was started on Seroquel 25mg 
QAM, 50mg QHS with additional doses prn at night.

#Chest Pain. ___ having reproducible R sided chest pain, worse 
with coughing. Ddx costochondritis, PNA, low suspicion for PE on 
HSQ ppx. NSAIDs were avoided given his eosinophilia and the pain 
was monitored for progression. 

# Anemia: The patient혪s hematocrit slowly trended down over the 
course of his hospital stay from the normal range down to 23 
from 37.9. He did not have any obvious site of hemorrhage. ___ 
iron studies c/w ACD (iron low, ferritin mildly elevated, low 
TIBC) possibly with component of iron defic but MCV low 90혪s and 
RDW WNL. Hemolysis labs neg and retic count 2.7%, index 0.79%. 
An active type and screen was obtained.

# Abnormal LFTs 혯 likely related to underlying infection. 
However hepatobiliary process also possible. RUQ US on ___ 
suggested acalculous cholecystitis, but he was seen by ACS who 
felt this was not the case as he was anasarcic (17L up) and his 
lactate was improving without source control. CK trended down. 
ID also suggested considering mycoplasma, which came back 
negative. By ___ transaminases remained elevated, including 
LDH; however haptoglobin was also elevated. Repeat RUQ u/s was 
unremarkable. EKG w/o evidence of ischemia, and cardiac enzymes 
negative.  Transaminases peaked ___, trending down ___ but alk 
phos still going up to 163. 
- f/u ID recs 
- hepatitis labs pending 
- Follow LFTs 

# ___: Likely secondary to multiorgan system dysfunction in the 
setting of severe sepsis (tachycardia, tachypnea, likely 
infection MODS). Has improved since the patient has received 
several liters of fluid. Urine eos negative. Cr trending down. 
Urine output picked up and medications were renally dosed.

# Anxiety: Patient on known benzodiazepines at home, and it 
appears he was also receiving others from his brother. 
___ were avoided given his altered mental status, 
and seroquel was given for agitation. 

#Hypernatremia. Started on lasix gtt ___, became hypernatremic 
to 147. Started on D5W, improved by ___.  D5W dc혪dd because pt 
receiving free water flushes through NGT. 

#Hyperkalemia. ___ K to 5.9 with peaked T혪s, got kayexelate and 
calcium gluconate and improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of hypertension, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, probable alcoholic 
cirrhosis, and alcohol abuse/dependence admitted with pneumonia 
and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Hospital course was notable 
for alcohol withdrawal, encephalopathy, and acute diastolic 
heart failure.

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure/Pneumonia/Severe exacerbation of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 
Chest X-ray was consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia and 
patient was requiried ICU admission and intubation. He was also 
given steroids for exacerbation of COPD and was able to be 
extubated. He completed his antibiotic course of Ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin during his hospitalization and was discharged off 
supplemental oxygen. He was also started on maintenance 
Tiotropium and inhaled fluticasone on discharge. 

#Acute diastolic heart failure:
Patient was felt to be volume overloaded on admission and was 
diuresed with improvement in pulmonary edema and oxygen 
requirement. Since he has had poor PCP follow up in the past and 
was felt to have heart failure exacerbation due to infection, 
which was treated prior to discharge, he was not discharged on 
diuretics. Echocardiogram showed mild symmetric LVH, preserved 
LVEF, and mild RV dilation.

#Alcohol withdrawal/encephalopathy/Cirrhosis:
Patient became delirious and agitated following extubation and 
this was felt to be due to alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazepine 
withdrawal. He was treated with Haldol and tapering doses of 
benzodiazepines and his mental status returned to normal prior 
to discharge. Although he had imaging consistent with cirrhosis, 
he was not felt to have hepatic encephalopathy. Abdominal 
ultrasound showed probable cirrhosis but no ascites. He was 
counseled on importance of abstaining from alcohol and was given 
folate and thiamine. He was maintained on CIWA protocol while on 
the medical floor. 

# Transitional issues:
Patient was discharged with PCP follow up of COPD, probable 
cirrhosis, diastolic heart failure, and alcohol abuse.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and 
cough and you were found to have pneumonia. You were admitted to 
the intensive care unit and a breathing tube was placed. You 
were treated with antibiotics and your symptoms improved. You 
were transferred to the medicine floor and continued to improve.

During your hospital stay, you underwent an ultrasound of your 
liver which shows liver disease. It is very important that you 
stop drinking alcohol, as this can further damage your liver and 
make you very sick. It is also important that you quit smoking, 
as this can increase your risk for developing pneumonia. You 
primary care doctor can help you with this.

It is very important you follow up with your primary care doctor 
regarding your multiple medical conditions. Please go to your 
scheduled appointments. You need to have your primary care 
doctor set up home physical therapy services. 

Please check your weights each morning and if you notice greater 
than 3 pound weight gain, please call your primary care doctor 
immediately, as this can represent worsening heart failure. 

The following changes were made to your medications: 
- Please START tiotropium inhaler daily -- this is to help with 
your lungs because you have emphysema
- Please STOP Symbicort
- Please START fluticasone inhaler -- this is also for your 
lungs
- Please START thiamine vitamins 

Please be sure to schedule a followup appointment with your 
primary care physician, ___.  

Dr. ___ set you up with a liver specialist, a lung 
specialist, and a heart specialist. 

1.) You likely have Emphysema from smoking so much, so you will 
need to start the inhalers, as listed below.  You will also need 
to have pulmonary function tests when you are feeling back to 
normal. 
Please try to cut back as much as possible on your smoking to 
make it easier to quit. 

2.) You were also found to have diastolic heart failure, which 
means that you can build up fluid easily in your lungs and legs 
if you eat extra salt.  Please try to avoid salt as much as 
possible in your diet.  Please also weigh yourself every morning 
before breakfast, as we discussed.  If you are gaining more than 
3 lbs, it is likely fluid weight, so you should call Dr. 
___, and he may need to start you on a medication 
called furosemide so that you can urinate out the extra fluid.

3.) You were also found to have cirrhosis of the liver, likely 
because of the alcohol you have been drinking over the years.  
Please try to stop drinking alcohol, as this can cause further 
harm to your liver.  You will need to follow with a liver 
specialist.

representing atrophy is likely age-related.  Mild hypodensity in 
periventricular white matter is seen, likely sequela of small 
vessel disease.  The basal cisterns appear patent and there is 
preservation of gray-white matter differentiation.  
No fracture is identified.  The visualized paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear.  Note is 
made of calcifications of the carotid siphons bilaterally.

___ 03:47AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.0 Mg-1.___ with h/o bladder and prostate cancer, DM, CKD, and COPD was 
found s/p fall by his wife, admitted to the MICU with sepsis 
likely from his UTI. He was found to have lung adenocarcinoma 
and pneumonia; his clinical status deteriorated during his stay 
likely due to his underlying sepsis, and the patient was made 
CMO ___. The patient was pronounced dead at 1:59a on ___. 

# Sepsis:
On presentation to the ED, the patient met ___ SIRS criteria, 
and had a lactate of 2.6. Foley placement then revealed purulent 
urine. CXR showed LUL consolidation. For hypoxemia, the patient 
was intubated from ___ - ___. Empiric antibiotics and 
antifungals were administered to cover his sepsis sources (lung, 
urine), but his blood pressures remained low and he continued to 
require vasopressors.  Following extensive discussions with the 
patient's wife and family, goals of care were transitioned to 
focus on comfort as a priority, a decision consistent with the 
patients' previously expressed wishes. On ___ pateint was CMO, 
and quietly expired later that evening.

# Left Lung Mass:
For opacification on CXR, a chest CT was obtained to further 
characterize the lesion and revealed a large left upper lobe 
mass invading the left pleural space and chest wall with 
involvement of the left anterior third and fourth ribs, highly 
suspicious for primary lung tumor. There was also ipsilateral 
and controlateral lymphadenopathy. ___ was consulted and an 
ultrasound-guided biopsy showed non-small cell carcinoma, favor 
lung adenocarcinoma. Some morphologic features in conjunction 
with the immunohistochemical staining profile raised the 
possibility of an adenosquamous carcinoma. Based on the 
patient's staging and clinical status, Oncology offered that 
there was low probability of cure for this cancer, though 
palliative chemotherapy and radiation would have been offered 
had his acute illness resolved. 
 
# Delirium
Pt was very agitated in the MICU, pulling at lines and requiring 
a Posey vest to keep him safe. He responded well to 1mg doses of 
IV haldol. On ___, haldol was switched to PO dosing PRN. At 
the time of his passing, the patient was comfortable.

# Tachycardia
Pt was tachycardic to > 130 on admission.  EKG on admission with 
TWI, which is likely rate related. A repeat EKG was unchanged. 
Cardiac enzymes were trended and remained negative. Sinus 
tachycardia persisted while in the MICU, fluid unresponsive, 
felt to be ___ agitation/delirium since HR trended with 
agitation. The patient was shortly bradycardic before his death. 


# Fall
Patient was 'found down' awake by his wife on the morning of 
presentation to the hospital.  All reports point to mechanical 
fall as he has been weaker than normal and typically ambulates 
with assistance.  She found him on his back and feels he slid 
out of bed.  Given AOCKD on initial presentation and clinical 
dehydration noted on exam, it is possible that orthostasis 
played a role. Prior to CMO, patient was monitored on telemetry 
while in the MICU without events. 

# Diabetes
HbA1c was 8.4% in ___, but ___ was > 400 when EMS arrived.  
Glipizide was held and blood glucose was controlled with sliding 
scale insulin while hospitalized. 
 
# HLD
Most recent lipid panel from ___ was total 227, HDL 74, LDL 
141.  His wife reports he was told to stop taking simvastatin. 

# Social situation
Concerns have been raised that his wife has been having 
difficulties caring for him at home and patient with at least 
two pressure ulcers present on admission. Social work was 
consulted. 

Further discussions were had with the family as the patient's 
respiratory status declined. Because of his multiple medical 
issues and declining clinical status, the family made the 
patient CMO prior to his passing.
 
Medications on Admission:
Per chart, patient reports not taking any pills.  His wife 
reports he only takes pills when she gives them too him (daily)

","___ with h/o bladder and prostate cancer, DM, CKD, and COPD was 
found on the floor by his wife this morning.  He does not recall 
the fall or if there was LOC or headstrike.  He was noted to be 
mentating well when EMS arrived.  His ___ at the time was > 400.  
His wife reports that she's noticed that he has had a runny nose 
for the past few days and he has been drinking more than normal. 
 He has been incontinent of urine since a ?bladder surgery.  He 
typically ambulates with assistance, but occasionally attempts 
to walk on his own.  He has no longer been driving because his 
family felt he was too weak. 

On the morning of admission, his wife found him on the floor 
lying on his back.  She hypothesizes that he slide down after 
being too weak to stand up when he was trying to get a drink.  
 
In the ED, initial vs were:  99.2 128 126/74 16 97%.  He was 
reported to mentate well and appeared comfortable overall.  A 
foley was placed and 'frank pus' was drained.  Urology was 
initially consulted given his difficult foley placement, but the 
ED was able to sucessfully place it and were able to visualize 
the balloon his the bladder on ultrasound per report.  Labs were 
significant for leukocytosis to 16.2 with 92% PMNs.  His 
creatinine was elevated to 1.7 from his apparent baseline of 
1.2-1.4.  His lactate was 2.5.  UA with > 182 WBCs.  A CXR was 
concerning for pneumonia.  He was given levaquin and CTX.  He 
was resuscitated with 2.5L of NS and his BP, although stable, 
began to down trend.  He is being admitted to the ICU for 
management of his sepsis.  He has 2 PIVs (18g and 20g) for 
access.  Vitals prior to transfer were  97.9 ___ 33 95% 
RA. 

On the floor, the patient is resting comfortably.  He is quite 
hard of hearing, making the interview difficult.  He denies any 
pain and feels well.  He is uncure of why he is in the hospital. 
 He does not have CP or SOB.  He has not had a cough.  He denies 
increased urinary frequency or dysuria.  Of note, the patient 
has not seen his PCP ___ ___, despite outreach for 
appointments. The patient was transferred to the ICU for 
hypotension.

History of Present Illness:
This is an ___ (not ___) yo M with
a history of CAD s/p MI ___ years prior, HLD, likely HTN and s/p
recent retinal surgery on the left who is transferred from
___ intubated and sedated for a higher level of
care. His wife provides the history, and she reports that he was
in his USOH until this afternoon around noon. At baseline he is
completely ""healthy"" and independent for all ADLs. He had been
nauseous for a few days. He was loading some dishes into the
dishwasher and suddenly fell backwards at around 12:30PM. Then 
he
walked out to take the trash out and couldn't climb the two 
steps
to come back into the house. Later, his wife sat him down 
because
his speech became garbled and he couldn't really understand what
his wife was saying. EMS was called because his wife was
concerned for a TIA. He was taken to an OSH, and was noted to be
nauseous and vomiting en route in the ambulance. While at this
OSH, he was noted to be hypertensive. He was given labetalol IV,
fosphenytoin 1g load and zofran and intubated for airway
protection. He had a NCHCT which revealed a left sided basal
ganglia bleed, and was thus transferred to the ___ for a 
higher
level of care. The wife denies that the patient is being
anticoagulated or ever having been treated for atrial
fibrillation.

EEG ___: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton 
activations. It showed a slow encephalopathic background 
throughout. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection 
are among the most common causes. There were no areas of 
prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal 
findings. There were no epileptiform features or electrographic 
seizurs. 

CT HEAD ___: IMPRESSION: 
1. The left basal ganglia hematoma is slightly decreased in 
size, though the associated mass effect is unchanged. No new 
hemorrhage. 
2. Decreased intraventricular blood. Stable ventricular size. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ arrived to the ___ intubated and sedated for a higher 
level of care for an intraparenchymal bleed into what was 
initially reported as the left basal ganglia, later confirmed to 
be largely thalamic in nature. On examination in the ED, he was 
found to have an atropine-related fixed and dilated left pupil, 
a dense right hemiparesis, spontaneous nonpurposeful movements 
of the left arm and would not follow commands or open his eyes. 

He was admitted to the neuro-ICU for close monitoring and q1hr 
neuro checks. His blood pressures have since been controlled 
under SBP<160 with PRN hydralazine/labetalol. A repeat NCHCT 
performed the following day showed no difference in bleed 
volume. 

He remained intubated for the next several days. The concern was 
that he would not be able to tolerate his secretions and that he 
was not following commands, both signs that extubation would be 
unsafe. His wife confirmed that he was a full code, but did 
communicate his wishes that he would not want to continue life 
""if he were a vegetable"". In the days following, he started to 
develop low grade fevers, an elevated WBC and thick secretions 
from his ETT suction. Out of concern for a community acquired 
pneumonia ___ possible aspiration) he was initiated on IV 
Ceftriaxone. His sputum and BAL cultures only grew out GNRs and 
respiratory commensal flora. Initiating antibiotic therapy did 
reduce his WBC and improve his fevers. His blood pressures 
remained under control, especially after the addition of a low 
dose of ACE inhibitor. 

We had a family meeting on ___ where we discussed (with 
his extended family and wife) that he has a long road to 
recovery, and that should be able to survive the various 
complications that may occur (e.g., DVTs, infections, etc.), he 
may be able to regain a greater degree of consciousness and 
appreciate his surroundings. We discussed how his weakness could 
improve and he may not be aphasic. We emphasized the long road 
to recovery. On ___, the decision was finally made to 
pursue tracheostomy and PEG tube placement in an attempt 
expedite his transition out of the ICU and to rehabilitation. 

He was continued on ceftriaxone for presumed CAP, but he 
continued to spike fevers through this.  His sputum Cx initially 
grew GNRs, but these cleared.  However, his CXR continued to 
show a consolidation that was worsening at the LLL base.  He was 
started on vancomycin and cefepime on ___ and his WBC and fever 
curve trended down.  He will need to complete a 14 day course 
for presumed VAP, which will stop on ___.  In addition, on 
___ he had a head CT done that showed that his bleed was 
stable, and so he was started on ASA 81mg QD.

PENDING LABS:
Blood culture ___
Sputum culture ___

TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:
We have been unable to ascertain who did patient's recent ripple 
retina procedure.  This will need to be determined, and they 
will need to be contacted to determine if patient requires 
specific eye drops for his post-surgical recovery.  His wife 
thought he may have been on atropine, but wasn't sure, and 
therefore this wasn't given here.  His wife had the medications 
at home and should be able to bring them to the rehab facility 
on request.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA 
currently receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister 
today to be confused and complaining of chest pain. He went to 
an OSH where he was found to have a platelet count of 7, lactate 
of 11.3, and WBC of 11.5 with 9% bands. He was moving all 
extremities but was lethargic. He had a fever and was given 1 
gram of vancomycin and 100mg of Gent for presumed sepsis. His 
head CT revealed right SAH. CT torso revealed a splenic infarct 
as well as infarct of the mesenteric vessels. The patient was 
transferred to ___ for further evaluation. He was given 
dilaudid 1mg IV x1 prior to transfer.  
.
In the ED at ___, patient was intubated on arrival for 
tachypnea to the ___. Repeat CT head showed parietal and 
temporal SAH, stable since OSH imaging. CT torso showed 
splenomegaly and wedge shaped infarcts in the the spleen and 
kidneys. Given platelets of 7, INR 1.9 and petachaie on exam, 
patients as presumed to be in DIC. Max temperature during ED 
course was temp of 104. Surgery was consulted and felt that 
patient was not an operative candidate. Neurosurgery evaluted 
the patient and advised transfusing platelets to 50, transfusing 
FFP to INR 1.4, Q1H neuro checks, and repeat head CT in the AM. 
In the Ed he received 2 units of FFP, 2 bags of platelets, 
gentamycin 100 mg IVx1, Flagyl 500 mg IVx1, cefepime 2g IVx1, 
vancomycin 1 g IV x1, thiamine 100 mg IV x1, and vigorous fluid 
resusciataion with 5L NS.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD 
FINDINGS: Again seen is subarachnoid hemorrhage along the right 
hemisphere.  This is stable in extent since the previous study. 
Within the left thalamus, there is a round focus of 
hypoattenuation with a lateral curvilinear focus of 
hyperattenuation, which is slightly increased in size since the 
previous study. This may just represent extension of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage around a 
perivascular space or extension superiorly from the choroidal 
fissure. 
Additional areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage are noted along the 
superior left parietal and frontal lobes, stable. No clear 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage is noted.  
  
The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. 
There is no 
significant mass effect. The gray-white matter differentiation 
is preserved.  There are secretions noted within the 
nasopharynx. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air 
cells are clear. No fractures are identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right-sided subarachnoid 
hemorrhage along 
the entire right hemisphere. Smaller areas of left-sided 
subarachnoid 
hemorrhage also relatively stable. No evidence of 
intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage. 
.
.
.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: 
Evaluation is limited due to the respiratory 
motion throughout the entire exam. Evaluation for pulmonary 
embolism is 
especially limited given motion and timing of contrast bolus. 
However, there are no large main pulmonary artery pulmonary 
embolisms. 
  
Multiple small pulmonary nodules are noted bilaterally in a far 
peripheral 
distribution measuring up to 9 x 5 mm (4:92). There is no 
pneumothorax or 
focal areas of consolidation. The heart size is normal. There is 
no 
pericardial effusion. There is no hilar, mediastinal or axillary 

lymphadenopathy. There is no aortic dissection. Gynecomastia is 
present. 
  
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The spleen is massively 
enlarged.  
Multiple areas of wedge-shaped hypoattenuated defects are 
present, most 
consistent with multiple splenic infarcts. Similarly, the 
kidneys bilaterally 
also demonstrate multiple peripheral wedge-shaped areas of 
hypoattneuation. 
  
The adrenal glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder are 
unremarkable. The 
intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are collapsed. There is no 
free air or 
free fluid. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is noted 
within a 
decompressed bladder. The prostate and rectum are within normal 
limits.  
There is apparent bowel wall thickening of the colon, from cecum 
to sigmoid 
colon. A small amount of free fluid is noted within the pelvis. 
There is no 
pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The arterial vasculature 
appears normal 
without evidence of vasculopathy. Although evaluation is limited 
as this is 
not an arterially timed phase and there is significant motion 
artifact, no 
occlusion is noted within the visualized abdominal and pelvic 
vasculature. 
  
BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are noted throughout the 
visualized spine, 
most prominent at L5-S1. Mild anterior loss of height of T11 and 
T12 of 
unknown chronicity. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
1. Multiple, small, peripheral nodules within the lungs. Given 
appearance 
and distribution of these nodules, diagnostic consideration 
favors septic 
emboli. 
  
2. Multiple areas of wedge-shaped hypoenhancement within the 
kidneys 
bilaterally and throughout the markedly enlarged spleen. These 
findings are 
concerning for infarcts in the kidneys bilaterally and spleen.  
  
3. Given findings in items number 1 and 2, septic emboli causing 
infarcts is 
a possibility. Further evaluation for a right to left cardiac 
shunt with 
echocardiography is recommended.  
  
4. Thickening of the ascending colonic wall, concerning for an 
infectious or 
ischemic process.  
.
.
.
TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. 
There is a moderate-sized (1.4cm x 0.9 cm) vegetation on the 
aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is 
seen on the mitral valve. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a 
moderate vegetation (1.2 cm x 0.9 cm) on the tricuspid valve. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve vegetation and tricuspid valve 
vegetation. Normal biventricular systolic function
.
.
ABDOMINAL U/S:  
1. Stable appearance of the liver with no new intra- or 
extra-hepatic biliary 
dilatation. Known cirrhosis. 
  
2. Stable perihepatic ascites and massive splenomegaly measuring 
up to 20.6 cm. 
.
TTE (___) 
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
(?#). There is a moderate-sized vegetation (1.0 cm long) on the 
aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a 
modreate to large vegetation (1.7 cm long) on the tricuspid 
valve. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the degree of TR and pulmonary hypertension detected have 
increased. The valve vegetations appear similar. If indicated, a 
TEE would better characterize the valvular vegetations.  

PORTABLE ABDOMINAL US ___: CLINICAL HISTORY: Clostridium 
difficile, evaluate for megacolon. Gas is seen within the 
stomach and a nasogastric tube is present. Some air is present 
within the transverse colon and the ascending colon. There is no 
evidence of bowel distention. IMPRESSION: No bowel distention. 

CXR ___: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, 
the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. On 
today's image, a part of the lateral left hemithorax is missing. 
There is no evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting 
pneumonia. The pre-existing areas of atelectasis have mostly 
cleared. No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal 
opacities suggesting pneumonia. Borderline size of the cardiac 
silhouette. No evidence of larger pleural effusions 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was 
found by his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain 
found to have endocarditis (aortic, tricuspid), MSSA Bacteremia, 
SAH, multiple septic infarcts to brain, liver, spleen, kidneys 
with hospital course complicated by DIC, acute renal failure 
requiring CVVH, and C.difficile associated disease, spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis.  
.
# ENDOCARDITIS, SEPSIS, SEPTIC EMBOLI: He was admitted to the 
MICU for further management. Blood cultures were sent and he was 
emperically started on broad spectrum antibiotics.  He was given 
IV fluids to maintain a CVP of ___.  Cultures grew out MSSA. 
His antibiotics were changed to Nafcillin and the Infectious 
Disease service was consulted.  Trans-thoracic echo confirmed 
aortic and tricuspid valve vegetations. The CT surgery team was 
consulted but no surgical management was undertaken. Imaging 
demonstrated multiple infarcts in the spleen, kidneys, lungs, 
liver, and brain consistent with septic emboli. The patient 
develpoed renal failure (see below) Repeat TTE one week after 
the initial ultrasound demonstrated new severe tricuspid 
regurgitation. EKG was checked daily to monitor for PR 
prolongation, which remained stable. Repeat cultures following 
treatment for MSSA bacteremia were negative. Ultimately, the 
patient developed renal failure and liver failure. Given the 
patient's multi-organ decline and poor prognosis a family was 
held and the patient was made CMO. He was taken off the 
ventilator and CVVH was held. He expired within two days of his 
family's decision to make him CMO.
.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. He developed anuric acute renal failure 
likely from combination of sepsis in low flow state with 
third-spacing, multiple likely septic renal infarcts, and 
possibly possible dye load. The renal service was consulted. He 
was started on CVVH. Medications were renally dosed. Nephrotoxic 
medications were held. Despite this he remained anuric with 
deterioratig renal function. Given the patient's multi-organ 
decline and poor prognosis a family was held and the patient was 
made CMO. CVVH was stopped at that time.
.
# LIVER FAILURE. The patient has known underlying liver disease 
secondary to HCV and alcoholism. Over the course of this 
admission, INR and bilirubin continued to trend up, until MELD 
was > 30 near the time of his demise. He was not considered a 
transplant candidate given his ongoing substance abuse problems 
and active infection.
.
# DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting 
of malignancy. There was no evidence of acute bleeding. DIC labs 
were monitored twice daily. Given the patient's multi-organ 
decline and poor prognosis a family was held and the patient was 
made CMO. 
. 
#SBP: He underwent a paracetntesis with cell count consistent 
with SBP. He was started on zosyn and ciprofloxacin with plans 
for a 14 day course. 
.
#C.DIFF ASSOCIATED DISEASE: He complained of abdominal pain and 
had bowel wall thickening on imaging. Stool was found to be 
positive for C-diff shortly before he passed away despite 
multiple negative prior stool studies. He was started on PO 
vancomycin and IV Flagyl. 
.
# SAH/?left basal infarct: The patient was noted to have small 
SAH on imaging. It was not clear whether this may have occurred 
in the setting of a fall. Neuro exam was nonfocal, and CT was 
unchanged between here and OSH where SAH was originally noted. 
Repeat imaging on ___ showing continued interval slight 
decrease in density of SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym 
was seen. Neurosurgery was consulted and initially angiogram was 
planned; however, given the patient's poor functional status and 
coagulopathy/DIC, risks were felt to outweigh benefits and the 
procedure was never done.
.
NSTEMI. The patient developed troponin leak in the setting of 
respiratory distress/agitation. This was felt to be most likely 
related to demand ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with PMH signficant for known 3VD CAD s/p 
PCI in ___ (BMS to LAD) and previously denied for CABG, COPD 
and h/o GIB who presents with chest pain and elevated troponins 
concerning for NSTEMI.   Patient arrived in the CCU following a 
intubated and sedated following an unsuccessful PCI of her RCA. 
Her course was complicated by cardiac ischemia, acute renal 
failure, right groin hematoma requiring vascular repair, hypoxic 
respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, and 
marked leukocytosis. Each of which is discussed below. Her 
clinical status declined throughout her CCU stay. She remained 
intubated following a failed extubation attempt and health care 
proxies were updated about her declining health status. Her 
family felt that she was clear that she wanted to be DNR and not 
on long-term life support.  Her granddaughter (___) and son 
(___) spoke to rest of the family and they were agreement with 
her change in code status. Her clinical status remained tenuous 
and on the morning of ___ she developed bradycardia, 
hypotension, diaphoresis and discomfort. An EKG was obtained 
which showed ST elevations in V2-V3. The attending and 
interventional fellow evaluated her and felt that she was 
unstable for PCI and that her ST elevation likely represented 
global ischemia from hypotension.  Her family was notified of 
her acutely worsening clinical status. She was given 1u PRBCs 
and nitroglycerin. Her bradycardia continued and she was given 
atropine with transient response. Her bradycardia devolved into 
a junctional rhythm followed by Vtach before becoming asystolic. 
Her official time of death was 09:32 AM.

Her clinical course was complicated by the following problems

# ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME:  Her presentation was consistent with 
Killip Class III indicating 38% mortality based on an updated 
study in JAMA performed at ___ and ___ 
published in ___. She had three vessel coronary artery disease 
and have previously declined surgical intervention. An initial 
PCI revealed a 99% RCA lesion which was unable to be intervened 
upon. She was evaluated by cardiac surgery who declined surgery 
given her history of severe COPD and extreme surgical risk given 
her concurrent comorbidities. She was maintained on aspirin and 
plavix. She had recurrent episodes of troponin elevations with 
ST depression in the inferior leads during episodes of 
hypotension and tachycardia. As she was not a surgical candidate 
the plan was made to intervene on RCA with laser therapy when 
clinically stable. 

# ACUTE DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: LVEF 40% per OSH 
echo done ___. BNP at OSH was ___. CXR shows diffuse 
pulmonary edema likely from acute CHF exacerbation vs LV 
dysfunction s/p MI vs flash pulmonary edema secondary to 
hypertensive urgency during cardiac cath. Her course was 
complicated by ischemic MR evidenced on TTE and high V waves on 
Right heart catheterization. A swan ganz catheter was placed to 
help aid in fluid balance which showed elevated PA pressures 
that decreased initially to diuresis though her renal function 
worsened with diuresis. At this point she was thought to be 
euvolemic and attempts were made to balance her fluid intake 
with urine output and estimated insensible losses. 

# ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline Cr reportedly 1.3. Cr 
1.6 at OSH. Her creatinine rose to 3.2 with concurrent uremia. 
Renal was consulted who felt that her decline in renal function 
was a pre-renal etiology. Potential etiologies include poor 
perfusion secondary to CHF exacerbation, gentamicin 
nephrotoxicity, possible UTI, lasix induced nephrotoxicity or 
contrast nephropathy. When her euvolemic state was reached with 
diuresis her kidney function began to improve though did not 
recover to baseline

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE Recently treated at ___ 
for Pseudomonas PNA as well as a COPD exacerbation. PNA treated 
with gentamicin and imipenem, course completed a few days prior 
to admission. Pulmonology was consulted to help guide extubation 
and evaluate her for cardiac surgery. She was felt to be a high 
surgical risk given her severe COPD. Extubation was attempted on 
___ though her respiratory status worsened acutely and she was 
quickly reintubated. She remained on a ventilatory. She had 
daily spontaneous breathing trials. She would at times do well 
with minimal pressure support but then would be seen to become 
apneic. The decision was made to keep her intubated during her 
acutely ill state until she clearly clinically improved or a 
plan was made for definitive intervention on her cardiac disease 
was made.

# LEUKOCYTOSIS: on ___ patient developed fever and 
leukocytosis despite being on vancomyicn and cefepime. ID was 
consulted given her chronic prednisone use and history of CVID 
requiring IVIG transfusions.  Her CVID put her at a different 
immune status than a normal host and we would be concerned for a 
plethora of infections especially with her recent ___ 
esophagitis and hsv esophagitis indicating her low immune system 
even as an outpatient.  Her white count peaked at 44.6 and she 
was started on acyclovir, micafungin and metronidazole for 
broader spectrum coverage which improved her white count. 

# RIGHT GROIN HEMATOMA + PSUEOANEURSYM: Following an extuabtion 
attempt on ___, Ms. ___ complained of severe thigh pain. A 
CT scan showed large hematoma. Right thigh was noted to be 
tense. Ultrasound showed large pseudoaneyrsm with continued 
flow. She was hemodynamically stable overnight Vascular felt 
there was no acute surgical issue. But a repeat U/S showed 
extensive hematoma which required surgical removal of thrombus 
and femoral artery repair.

h/o GIB and recent inpatient stay at ___ for 
Pseudomonas PNA who presents from ___ after she 
presented there complaining of progressively worsening chest 
pain and dyspnea. Her symptoms began one week prior to admission 
and was associated with lower extremity edema, orthopnea and 
DOE. Patient was previously cathed in ___ and noted to have 3VD 
but only the LAD lesion was intervened on. She presented to 
___ on ___ where she was found to have BNP 
2100, Cr of 1.6 (baseline 1.3) and admitted to the ICU there 
with a CHF exacerbation. While in the ___, she 
developed crushing substernal chest pain with associated right 
arm and neck pain. Troponins were 0.72 without acute ST-T wave 
changes. She was started on a heparin gtt, nitro gtt and lasix. 
Troponins downtrended overnight. EKG initially showed sinus 
tachycardia with LBBB but then degenerated into an accelerated 
junctional rhythm then 3rd degree heart block. She was 
transferred to ___ for urgent catheterization. 

Cath on ___ showed patent BMS in the LAD. LCx disease was 
unchanged from prior cath. There was an ulcerated and calcified 
99% RCA lesion felt to be the culprit which was not intervened 
upon (lesion was crossed with wire but not balloon or stent). 
Peak gradient across aortic valve was 15mmHg. PCWP was 32, EDP 
was also elevated. While in the recovery area, patient reported 
worsening dypsnea and anxiety. She became hypoxic to the ___ and 
hypertensive (unknown SBP) concerning for flash pulmonary edema. 
She was given IV lasix 160mg x1, albuterol and solumedrol 60mg 
x1. She was started on a nitro gtt for hypertension. She

Angioseal placed in R femoral access site. Venous sheath was 
left in place overnight to use in AM for relook (rota vs laser 
RCA intervention). She was loaded with prasugrel 60mg prior to 
coming to the CCU.

In the CCU, patient is intubated and sedated.
